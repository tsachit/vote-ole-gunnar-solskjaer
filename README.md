# vote-ole-gunnar-solskjaer
Basically I wrote this script using taiko and nodejs to vote my favorite club(Manchester United) manager, Ole gunnar solskjaer, as manager of the month for February 2020 :D

To see how the script works in GUI, use the following script since this only runs once

    $ taiko voting-ole.js --observe

To run the script in **n** number of times change the value of **"max"** in **"voting-ole-loop.js"** file and run the following script

    $ taiko voting-ole-loop.js

This will simply run the script in background.



The script seems to be running fine :D

**Note:** Did this for fun and learning purpose only so if your manager didn't win I'm sorry. Lol
